    "content": "Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0 (EPL-1.0)\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC\nLICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n        i) changes to the Program, and\n        ii) additions to the Program;\n\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself\nor anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\nadditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\ndistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\nand (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or\nwhen combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with\nthis Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,\n       in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\n       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,\n       in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply\n       to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time\n       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n       combinations which include the Contribution.\n       No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes\n       sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\n       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n       before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n       license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n        consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\nif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to\nidentify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and\nindemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any\nlosses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\nlawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the\nIndemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply\nto any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual\nproperty infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\na) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.\nIf that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties\nare such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,\nthe Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,\nthe Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nEach Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of\nusing and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability\nor interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by\nthe parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and\ndoes not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\naware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this\nAgreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the\nProgram as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations\nunder this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the\nProgram shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\nonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\nthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\nfrom time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to\nmodify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial\nAgreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to\nserve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\nof the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version\nof the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version\nof the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America.
